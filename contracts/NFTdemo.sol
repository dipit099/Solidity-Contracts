//In Ethereum, address(0) is a special address that represents an uninitialized or non-existent address. It is commonly used as a sentinel value to indicate "no address" or "address not set".
//5.x release notes states that: The _exists function was removed. 
//Calls to this function can be replaced by _ownerOf(tokenId) != address(0)


//i tried to transfer a nft from one owner to another . 
//only the owner of that nft can transfer that. so nice
